# liri-node-app
Introduction
---
I created a node.js app called LIRI. LIRI is like SIRI (from an iphone).

It must be run in the command line.

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will do any of the below command when you enter them into the command line.

my-tweets
---------

spotify-this-song
-----------

movie-this
----------

do-what-it-says
---------------


Type in node liri.js to get the instructions on how to enter the commands correctly. So if you were to type the below command you'd get the last 20 tweets I created (There may not be 20 tweets for me I just created an account)

node liri.js my-tweets
----------------------


node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
-----------------------------
shows the following information about the song in the terminal

artist(s)

song name

preview link of the song from spotify

album that the song is a part of


Example for movie
------------------
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'
this would output the following information to the terminal:
